# GetCleanData
Coursera Course 3 Project


First step installs the dplyr package and uses it

The next step I check for existence of the directory and if it does not exist then I create it and download and unzip the zip file in the directory named UCI HAR Dataset

There after I have commented the R script appropriately to show what is being done for each of the steps.
